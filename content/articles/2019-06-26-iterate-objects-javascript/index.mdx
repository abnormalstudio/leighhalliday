How do you iterate over objects in JavaScript? In this article we'll answer this question by showing 3 alternatives.

<YouTube id="lbmGa_0lA9I" />

The data we'll be using for this article contains the name of 3 Toronto Raptors, with a unique key property for each of them.

```js
const raptors = {
  aaa111: {
    name: "Kawhi Leonard"
  },
  bbb222: {
    name: "Kyle Lowry"
  },
  ccc333: {
    name: "Spicy P"
  }
};
```

## Mapping Keys

The first approach uses [Object.keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Object/keys), which when passed an object will return you an array containing the keys (properties/attributes) of the object. With the keys we can map them, using each key to access the correct attribute to grab each Raptor's name.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {Object.keys(raptors).map(key => (
        <li key={key}>{raptors[key].name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Mapping Values

The second approach uses [Object.values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Object/values), which when passed an object will return you an array containing the values of the object.

If you have an `id` or some other unique value for each of the values, awesome! But if you don't, this approach has some downfalls as you may not have access to the value's key.

In this example we'll use the Raptor's name because it happens to be unique.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {Object.values(raptors).map(raptor => (
        <li key={raptor.name}>{raptor.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Mapping Entries

The third approach uses [Object.entries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Object/entries), which when passed an object will return you an array, where each element in the array is another array that has two values (a tuple): `[key, value]`.

This approach easily gives us access to both the key and the value, providing the most flexible approach of the three that we have looked at.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {Object.entries(raptors).map(([key, raptor]) => (
        <li key={key}>{raptor.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```
