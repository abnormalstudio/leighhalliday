## What is the Tap method? 
 
Ruby's `tap` method allows you to "tap into" a method chain, modify an object and receive that same object as the result. An Engine Yard blog recently spoke about [five ruby methods you should be using](https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/five-ruby-methods-you-should-be-using) in which `tap` was one of them. 
 
## Let's create our own Tap method 
 
I got to thinking that unless I'm seriously missing something, it can't be too much work to create my own `tap` method. I wasn't wrong. I attempted to create it and named it `tapme` to give it a unique name, and it ended up being only 2 lines of code. 
 
```ruby 
class Object 
  def tapme 
    yield(self) 
    self 
  end 
end 
``` 
 
I then wanted to see if I could check out [how Ruby actually implemented tap in its source](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Object.html#method-i-tap), and it turns out that it is basically the same. 
 
```c 
rb_obj_tap(VALUE obj) 
{ 
  rb_yield(obj); 
  return obj; 
} 
``` 
 
## Using our tapme method 
 
I wanted to come up with a quick little, somewhat contrived demo of our `tapme` method in action. I think Llamas and Alpacas are pretty hilarious, so I created an Alpaca object, with name, spouse, and marital status attributes, and created a method which would marry 2 alpacas, using the `tapme` method as part of a method chain which prints out a string representation of our alpaca's marital status. 
 
```ruby 
class Alpaca 
 
  attr_accessor :name, :spouse, :marital_status 
 
  def initialize(name) 
    self.name = name 
    self.marital_status = :single 
  end 
 
  def marry(partner, update_partner = true) 
    tapme { |me| 
      me.marital_status = :married 
      me.spouse         = partner 
      partner.marry(me, false) if update_partner 
    } 
  end 
 
  def marital_string 
    case marital_status 
    when :single 
      "#{name} is single." 
    when :married 
      "#{name} is married to #{spouse.name}." 
    when :divorced 
      "#{name} is divorced." 
    else 
      "#{name}'s marital status is unknown." 
    end 
  end 
 
end 
 
spitty  = Alpaca.new("Spitty") 
huacaya = Alpaca.new("Huacaya") 
 
puts spitty.marry(huacaya).marital_string 
``` 
 
Calling our code produces this result: 
 
```bash 
ruby tapme.rb  
Spitty is married to Huacaya. 
``` 
 
And there we go! We we're able to re-implement Ruby's `tap` method. I wonder what other Ruby methods are this easy to implement?
