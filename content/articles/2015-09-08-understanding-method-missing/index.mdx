In this article we are going to look at `method_missing` and `respond_to_missing?` in order to see what they do and how they can be used. We're going to re-create the [StringInquirer](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/string_inquirer.rb) class in Ruby on Rails as a way to demonstrate what is happening and how it can be used in real applications. 
 
## What is StringInquirer 
 
If you've used Rails you've probably had to check at one point or another which environment your app is running in. To do this you probably called `Rails.env.staging?`. What I didn't know until recently was that `env` was an instance of the StringInquirer class. 
 
StringInquirer allows you to check if a String is equal to something by asking it `staging?` rather than `env == "staging"`. 
 
## NoMethodError 
 
You've probably seen the NoMethodError exception many times while programming Ruby. The code below will produce the NoMethodError exception because the method `happy?` doesn't exist. 
 
```ruby 
class StringInquirer < String 
end 
 
mood = StringInquirer.new("happy") 
mood.happy? 
``` 
 
When you call `happy?` Ruby will check to see if your object "responds to" this method... or in other words, if a method exists with that name either in the current object, or any other class up the hierarchy chain. 
 
In this case it can't find the method `happy?` so it raises the exception; but Ruby allows us to implement a method called `method_missing` which is called as a last ditch attempt to find a receiver for this method call. `method_missing` receives the name of the method that was being called along with the rest of the arguments that were passed to the method we wanted to call. 
 
If we add `method_missing` to our class and print out the values passed to it, we can get an idea of what we're working with. 
 
```ruby 
class StringInquirer < String 
 
  private 
    def method_missing(method_name, *arguments) 
      puts method_name.inspect 
      puts arguments.inspect 
    end 
end 
``` 
 
Which will print out the following: 
 
```ruby 
:happy? 
[] 
``` 
 
Using this knowledge, we want to check if the method_name ends with a question mark and, if so, check to see if the beginning of the method name is equal to the value of our string. If it doesn't end with a question mark, we can call `super` passing off responsibility to some parent class. 
 
```ruby 
class StringInquirer < String 
 
  private 
    def method_missing(method_name, *arguments) 
      if method_name[-1] == '?' 
        self == method_name[0..-2] 
      else 
        super 
      end 
    end 
end 
``` 
 
This updated code now correctly returns `true` when asking `happy?` and will return false if we asked it something like `sad?`. 
 
## Does my object respond to? 
 
Sometimes before you call a method you want to first ask your object if it will be able to respond to this method. To do this you can use the method `respond_to?` passing the method name to the method. 
 
```ruby 
"Happy".respond_to?(:length) # => true 
``` 
 
But because our question mark methods `happy?` or `sad?` don't actually exist, it's going to give us false no matter what. 
 
There is one other method we can implement to help us handle the case where it can't find a concrete method to call. This is `respond_to_missing?`. 
 
`respond_to_missing?` receives the name of the method and another value called include_private which we won't worry about now. In our case, we basically want to check if the method being called ends with a question mark or not. 
 
This leads us to our final implementation of the StringInquirer class, which has implemented both `method_missing` and `respond_to_missing?`. 
 
```ruby 
class StringInquirer < String 
  private 
 
    def respond_to_missing?(method_name, include_private = false) 
      method_name[-1] == '?' 
    end 
 
    def method_missing(method_name, *arguments) 
      if method_name[-1] == '?' 
        self == method_name[0..-2] 
      else 
        super 
      end 
    end 
end 
``` 
 
We can use the class like so: 
 
```ruby 
mood = StringInquirer.new("happy") 
p mood.happy? # => true 
p mood.sad? # => false 
p mood.respond_to?(:happy?) # => true 
``` 
 
## Concluding thoughts 
 
We've covered the use of 2 methods (method_missing and respond_to_missing?) to perform a little bit of what is called "Meta Programming". Allowing our code to ask questions about itself and create new functionality on the fly. 
 
When you want to add a little "syntactic sugar" to your code, perhaps using these 2 methods will help you achieve that. Worst case scenario is that you've come away with knowledge of how the StringInquirer class - which is part of the ActiveSupport module of Rails - works. The next time you use `Rails.env.development?` you'll know what is happening. I recommend [Metaprogramming Ruby 2](https://amzn.to/2pyq8pm) to go deeper on this subject.
