When building a RESTful API in Rails, there are many different options and gems you can use to format your JSON responses. This isn't a post about how to build an API, but rather about some of the different popular options on how to define and structure JSON. 
 
### RABL 
 
[RABL](https://github.com/nesquena/rabl) is a DSL for generating both JSON and XML. In my mind it has a similar feel to Jbuilder, which I'll discuss below. It's works by creating a view with the extension .rabl, and defining which attributes, nodes, and relations you wish to include in the JSON response. Here's an example taken from their GitHub README. 
 
```ruby 
# app/views/posts/index.rabl 
collection @posts 
attributes :id, :title, :subject 
child(:user) { attributes :full_name } 
node(:read) { |post| post.read_by?(@user) } 
``` 
 
### Active Model Serializer 
 
[Active Model Serializer](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers) is a great way to build JSON responses using an object oriented approach. The objects have a very similar feel to how your ActiveModel object is set up in terms of attributes and relationships. It also allows you to choose your adapter-to decide what type of JSON structure is produced-or to build your own. Popular supported formats are JSON-API and JSON-HAL. 
 
```ruby 
class PostSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer 
  attributes :title, :body 
  has_many :comments 
  url :post 
end 
``` 
 
### Jbuilder 
 
[Jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder) provides a very similar DSL to RABL. Jbuilder is included with Rails, so it is used quite a bit. [Rails Casts](http://railscasts.com/episodes/320-jbuilder) has a free episode which goes into greater detail about Jbuilder. It's very easy to use and provides a lot of flexibility in defining exactly what attributes are included in and how the response is formatted and nested. 
 
```ruby 
# app/views/message/show.json.jbuilder 
json.content format_content(@message.content) 
json.(@message, :created_at, :updated_at) 
 
json.author do 
  json.name @message.creator.name.familiar 
  json.email_address @message.creator.email_address_with_name 
  json.url url_for(@message.creator, format: :json) 
end 
``` 
 
### Grape Entity 
 
[Grape Entity](https://github.com/intridea/grape-entity) was extracted from [Grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape), which is a popular gem used for building RESTful APIs. Similarly to RABL and Jbuilder, it provides a DSL for defining entities which are the structure of your JSON response. 
 
```ruby 
module API 
  module Entities 
    class Status < Grape::Entity 
      expose :user_name 
      expose :text, documentation: { type: "String", desc: "Status update text." } 
      expose :ip, if: { type: :full } 
      expose :user_type, :user_id, if: lambda { |status, options| status.user.public? } 
      expose :contact_info do 
        expose :phone 
        expose :address, using: API::Address 
      end 
    end 
  end 
end 
``` 
 
### ROAR 
 
[ROAR](https://github.com/apotonick/roar) allows you to build presenter classes to represent your data. It comes with support for JSON, JSON-HAL, JSON-API, and XML. 
 
```ruby 
require 'roar/json' 
 
module SongRepresenter 
  include Roar::JSON 
  property :title 
end 
``` 
 
### ActiveModel or Hash 
 
This may seem like a strange thing to point out, but for very simple cases, you can simply call the to_json method on either an ActiveModel object or a native Ruby Hash. 
 
```ruby 
# Using an @organization model 
respond_to do |format| 
  format.json do 
    render json: @organization.to_json 
  end 
end 
``` 
 
```ruby 
# Using a plain Ruby Hash 
respond_to do |format| 
  format.json do 
    render json: { 
      name: @user.name, 
      email: @user.email 
    }.to_json 
  end 
end 
``` 
 
### JSON Specifications 
 
For more information on some of the different JSON structures, please refer to the links below. I will be writing an article at a later time specifically about how these options differ from one another.
