It’s common for a Ruby developer to describe themselves as a Rails developer. It’s also common for someone’s entire Ruby experience to be through [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). Rails began in 2003 by [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/), quickly becoming the most popular web framework and also serving as an introduction to Ruby for many developers.
