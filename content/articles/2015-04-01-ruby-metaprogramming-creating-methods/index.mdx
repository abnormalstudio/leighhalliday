## Creating Methods

In this post I'll be discussing another aspect of metaprogramming in Ruby. The ability to create methods dynamically, during runtime. There are many reasons to do this, but one of them is to allow you to write generator methods to help you avoid writing repetitive code.

## The Long Way

It's generally a good practice in Ruby to not access instance variables directly but instead through getter and setter methods. Unless something fancy is happening, these methods don't really do much other than get a value and set a value to the instance variable.

```ruby
class Alpaca
  def initialize
    @name
  end

  def name
    @name
  end

  def name=(value)
    @name = value
  end
end

buddy = Alpaca.new("Buddy")
buddy.name # Buddy
```

This is really annoying to write... and thankfully Ruby comes with an easy way to get this same functionality with only having to write a single line of code.

## Enter attr_accessor!

Ruby comes with 3 methods to help you create instance variable getters and setters. `attr_reader` creates a getter, `attr_writer` creates a setter, and `attr_accessor` creates both. To use this we just have to declare it at the top of our class, and Ruby will essentially create our getters and setters for us!

```ruby
class Alpaca
  attr_accessor :name
  def initialize(name)
    self.name = name
  end
end

buddy = Alpaca.new("Buddy")
puts buddy.name # "Buddy"
```

## Let's do this ourselves

Because Ruby it is a dynamic language that allows us to create (and remove) methods during runtime, let's try to essentially re-create what Ruby has done for us with the `attr_accessor` code. We'll call it `getset`, `getter`, and `setter`.

We can use the `define_method` method to dynamically create a new method. It accepts the name of the method, and we pass it a block of code, which will become the body of our new method.

To complete this code, we'll also use the `instance_variable_get` and `instance_variable_set` methods to dynamically get and set our instance variables directly.

```ruby
# Let's create a base class to extend from.
# This class contains the code generator methods that we'll be using.
class Base
  def self.getset(*args)
    args.each do |field|
      getter(field)
      setter(field)
    end
  end

  def self.getter(*args)
    args.each do |field|
      define_method(field) do
        instance_variable_get("@#{field}")
      end
    end
  end

  def self.setter(*args)
    args.each do |field|
      define_method("#{field}=") do |value|
        instance_variable_set("@#{field}", value)
      end
    end
  end
end

# Now let's create a class and utilize our getset generator
class Alpaca < Base
  # We'll create accessors for :name and :age
  getset :name, :age

  def initialize(name, age)
    self.name = name
    self.age  = age
  end
end

buddy = Alpaca.new("Buddy", 24)
# Let's call our methods and make sure they return what we expect
puts buddy.name # Buddy
puts buddy.age # 24

# Let's see if our object responds to the new methods we created
puts buddy.respond_to?(:name) # true
puts buddy.respond_to?(:name=) # true
```

## Concluding thoughts

If you're a Rails developer, you've probably called methods which were dynamically generated before whether you knew it or not. Your Rails models have had methods created dynamically for each attribute on that model. This is the reason why you can call `@user.name` without having to create a getter method for the `name` attribute.

Another example of a way I've used this technique before is when working with money fields in my Rails models. The values are stored in cents in the database, but often you just want to display the dollar equivalent to your user. To do this we have a code generator to define `money_fields` which creates methods for each of the fields and provides methods to easily get/set the values in either cents or in dollars.
