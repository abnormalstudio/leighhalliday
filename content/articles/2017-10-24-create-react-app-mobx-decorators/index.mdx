Create React App is a great way to get up and running with React. It comes configured with sane defaults which are great for most people, but unfortunately we'll need to make a few changes before we can use MobX. 
 
I'm a huge fan of MobX and it's been my go-to state management tool for the different React projects I work on. Definitely give it a try if you have so far used Redux or have stuck with component state. 
 
** UPDATE!! ** - There is a new article I published which shows how to use MobX in create-react-app without having to eject. [Check it out here.](https://www.leighhalliday.com/mobx-create-react-app-without-ejecting) 
 
## Creating a new Create React App 
 
First thing you'll need is to install `create-react-app` globally, which can be done with `npm install create-react-app -g`. At the time of this article I am using version 1.4.1. 
 
Once you have that package installed, you can run the command `create-react-app birds` to create your app. 
 
## Installing MobX 
 
Add MobX to your package file by running `yarn add mobx mobx-react`... easy! On to the next step. 
 
## Ejecting from Create React App 
 
MobX is a state management tool and we need a way to inject the global state into our components as needed and have them observe changes to the state, forcing them to re-render with the updated data. Although not a requirement, through the use of decorators MobX provides an easy way to do both of these things. 
 
For the time being, create-react-app doesn't come with Babel support for decorators, but it is easy to add. To do that we will have to eject from create-react-app with the command `yarn run eject`. This will give us full control of all of the packages and configuration of our app. 
 
## Installing Decorator Support 
 
Now that we have ejected we can add an additional babel plugin which provides decorator support. We want to install `yarn add babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy`. Don't be fooled by the name "legacy", this is the most recent package of a very new feature of JS. 
 
Next, go find the "babel" config option in the `package.json` file. We want to add this new package as a plugin. Our config should look like: 
 
```json 
"babel": { 
  "plugins": ["babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy"], 
  "presets": ["react-app"] 
}, 
``` 
 
## Creating MobX Store 
 
I like to have a `stores` folder for my MobX store(s). We're going to create that in the `src` folder and we'll name our file `BirdStore.js`. 
 
A store in MobX is typically comprised of three things: 
- observable properties 
- actions (functions) which modify the state (the observable properties) 
- computed functions which derive their values from our existing properties 
 
It's important to note that we are not going to export the class itself but an instance of it. We want a single instance of this store app-wide. 
 
```js 
import { observable, action, computed } from 'mobx'; 
 
class BirdStore { 
  // to be implemented later on 
} 
 
const singleton = new BirdStore(); 
export default singleton; 
``` 
 
## Creating MobX Provider 
 
In order to eventually "inject" MobX into our components, we need to wrap a `Provider` component around our App component. To this component we'll pass each of our stores as a prop. 
 
Inside of our Provider we'll have a Birds component. 
 
```js 
import React, { Component } from 'react'; 
import { Provider } from 'mobx-react'; 
import BirdStore from './stores/BirdStore'; 
import Birds from './Birds'; 
 
class App extends Component { 
  render() { 
    return ( 
      <Provider BirdStore={BirdStore}> 
        <Birds /> 
      </Provider> 
    ); 
  } 
} 
 
export default App; 
``` 
 
The Birds component so far looks like this: 
 
```js 
import React, { Component } from 'react'; 
 
export default class Birds extends Component { 
  render() { 
    return <div>Birds</div>; 
  } 
} 
``` 
 
## Injecting & Observing 
 
To be able to use our store from within a component, and to have it react (re-render) to changes in our store's state, we'll use 2 decorators provided by MobX. We can inject any store that was included in the `Provider` from the step above. 
 
```js 
import React, { Component } from 'react'; 
import { inject, observer } from 'mobx-react'; 
 
@inject('BirdStore') 
@observer 
export default class Birds extends Component { 
  render() { 
    // access our store via the props 
    const { BirdStore } = this.props; 
 
    return <div>Birds</div>; 
  } 
} 
``` 
 
## Adding functionality to store 
 
Let's go back to our store and provide it with some functionality. We will have 1 observable property called `birds` which is an array, an action called `addBird` which pushes a bird onto the birds array, and a computed function which tells us how many birds we have in our array. 
 
```js 
class BirdStore { 
  @observable birds = []; 
 
  @action 
  addBird = bird => { 
    this.birds.push(bird); 
  }; 
 
  @computed 
  get birdCount() { 
    return this.birds.length; 
  } 
} 
``` 
 
## Using store within component 
 
We can start off by showing the number of birds we have by using the `birdCount` computed function from the store. Because it is a getter function, you don't have to call it with `()`... you can treat it as if you were reading a property. 
 
```js 
<h2>You have {BirdStore.birdCount} birds</h2> 
``` 
 
Next we can have a form that adds a new bird to the store: 
 
```js 
<form onSubmit={e => this.handleSubmit(e)}> 
  <input 
    type="text" 
    ref={input => (this.birdInput = input)} 
    placeholder="Add a bird" 
  /> 
</form> 
``` 
 
And the `handleSubmit` function looks like: 
 
```js 
handleSubmit = e => { 
  e.preventDefault(); 
  this.props.BirdStore.addBird(this.birdInput.value); 
  e.target.reset(); 
}; 
``` 
 
Finally we can list all of the birds in our store: 
 
```js 
<ul>{BirdStore.birds.map(bird => <li key={bird}>{bird}</li>)}</ul> 
``` 
 
The finished component looks like: 
 
```js 
import React, { Component } from 'react'; 
import { inject, observer } from 'mobx-react'; 
 
@inject('BirdStore') 
@observer 
export default class Birds extends Component { 
  handleSubmit = e => { 
    e.preventDefault(); 
    this.props.BirdStore.addBird(this.birdInput.value); 
    e.target.reset(); 
  }; 
 
  render() { 
    const { BirdStore } = this.props; 
 
    return ( 
      <div> 
        <h2>You have {BirdStore.birdCount} birds</h2> 
 
        <form onSubmit={e => this.handleSubmit(e)}> 
          <input 
            type="text" 
            ref={input => (this.birdInput = input)} 
            placeholder="Add a bird" 
          /> 
        </form> 
 
        <ul>{BirdStore.birds.map(bird => <li key={bird}>{bird}</li>)}</ul> 
      </div> 
    ); 
  } 
} 
``` 
 
## Conclusion 
 
In this tutorial we built a small create-react-app and added MobX to it with support for decorators. We also built a small component which utilized all of our stores functionality... displaying a computed value, calling an action function, and looping through all of the birds in our observable property.
