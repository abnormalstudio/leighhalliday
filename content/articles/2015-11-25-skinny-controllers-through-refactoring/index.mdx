Controllers can get out of control. Their job should generally be quite simple. In an MVC framework such as Rails, they should have the job of knowing how to work with the Model in order to get what is needed for the View. In other words, they receive the user input (through `params`) and determine what the output should be (such as rendering JSON). 
 
Most of the time this sort of "traffic cop" role stays small, but sometimes you might find the controller getting more and more private methods to help parse complicated user input to generate complicated output or queries. If you find your controllers getting uncomfortably large, or hard to test all of the different scenarios they have to deal with, it might be time to refactor your code. 
 
Let's take the example of the `index` action of the `RentalUnitsController`. This example comes from a series of articles I wrote about [creating JSON APIs with Rails 5](http://blog.codeship.com/building-a-json-api-with-rails-5/) and [part 2](http://blog.codeship.com/the-json-api-spec/) which goes into more depth in terms of having the API conform to the json:api spec. It turns out that the spec defines a number of ways that index actions might be filtered, sorted, paginated, etc... which can add a lot of logic to your controllers. 
 
## Extracting complicated query logic 
 
We've seen that our controller is going to require a fair amount of logic to handle sorting, pagination, and potentially filtering the data as part of the `index` action. I have extracted this logic into a class called `RentalUnitsIndex`. Classes should have a single responsibility, and the responsibility of this class is to take the `params` coming from the user, parse them and build a query based on them. As part of the job it will also build the pagination links that go along with the query to move from page to page. 
 
This is what our `index` method in the controller now looks like... quite small, no? 
 
```ruby 
def index 
  rental_units_index = RentalUnitsIndex.new(self) 
  render json: rental_units_index.rental_units, links: rental_units_index.links 
end 
``` 
 
For the `RentalUnitsIndex` class to do its job we will pass it `self`, which is actually the controller itself. By having access to the controller, we can access not only the `params` but also the helper URLs that Rails creates as part of the routing system. 
 
Here is the class in its entirety. We'll break down specific methods as we write tests to ensure that it works as expected. 
 
```ruby 
class RentalUnitsIndex 
 
  DEFAULT_SORTING = {created_at: :desc} 
  SORTABLE_FIELDS = [:rooms, :price_cents, :created_at] 
  PER_PAGE = 10 
 
  delegate :params, to: :controller 
  delegate :rental_units_url, to: :controller 
 
  attr_reader :controller 
 
  def initialize(controller) 
    @controller = controller 
  end 
 
  def rental_units 
    @rental_units ||= RentalUnit.includes(:user). 
      order(sort_params). 
      paginate(page: current_page, per_page: PER_PAGE) 
  end 
 
  def links 
    { 
      self:  rental_units_url(rebuild_params), 
      first: rental_units_url(rebuild_params.merge(first_page)), 
      prev:  rental_units_url(rebuild_params.merge(prev_page)), 
      next:  rental_units_url(rebuild_params.merge(next_page)), 
      last:  rental_units_url(rebuild_params.merge(last_page)) 
    } 
  end 
 
  private 
 
    def current_page 
      (params.to_unsafe_h.dig(:page, :number) || 1).to_i 
    end 
 
    def first_page 
      {page: {number: 1}} 
    end 
 
    def next_page 
      {page: {number: next_page_number}} 
    end 
 
    def prev_page 
      {page: {number: prev_page_number}} 
    end 
 
    def last_page 
      {page: {number: total_pages}} 
    end 
 
    def total_pages 
      @total_pages ||= rental_units.total_pages 
    end 
 
    def next_page_number 
      [total_pages, current_page + 1].min 
    end 
 
    def prev_page_number 
      [1, current_page - 1].max 
    end 
 
    def sort_params 
      SortParams.sorted_fields(params[:sort], SORTABLE_FIELDS, DEFAULT_SORTING) 
    end 
 
    def rebuild_params 
      @rebuild_params ||= begin 
        rejected = ['action', 'controller'] 
        params.to_unsafe_h.reject { |key, value| rejected.include?(key.to_s) } 
      end 
    end 
 
end 
``` 
 
I'm a big fan of using the `delegate` method in this case to give us easier access to the two methods that we access most often from the `controller` object that is passed to this class. It allows us to simply call `params` instead of `controller.params`. 
 
## Testing our extracted class 
 
By having what is essentially a query builder class extracted out of the controller, it allows us to test it more easily. We no longer have to make full requests to the controller each time. We can test individual methods and what their output is. 
 
In these tests I am going to create an extra class to help with testing. It is small and will help me basically create fake/stubbed out instances of the controller and the params. The reason I've done this is so that I don't have to involve the real one, because the truth is that it doesn't matter as long as it responds to the same methods. In this case it must respond to `params` and `rental_units_url`. 
 
We are using the real `ActionController::Parameters` (or "Strong Params") class that Rails uses internally. With Rails 4 came Strong Params, allowing us to require and permit specific keys, on top of the functionality that Rails 3 had with `HashWithIndifferentAccess` (allowing us to use the `:key` symbol form or `"key"` string form to access the same value). 
 
```ruby 
RSpec.describe RentalUnitsIndex, :type => :model do 
 
  class FakeController 
    attr_accessor :params 
 
    def initialize(params) 
      @params = params 
    end 
 
    def rental_units_url(*args) 
      "http://www.fake.com" 
    end 
  end 
 
  let(:controller) { FakeController.new(params) } 
  let(:params) do 
    ActionController::Parameters.new({ 
      sort: sort, 
      page: page 
    }) 
  end 
  let(:sort) { "-rooms" } 
  let(:page) { {number: "1"} } 
  let(:rui) { RentalUnitsIndex.new(controller) } 
``` 
 
By putting each param into its own `let` statement, we can control those individually as we test the different methods of our class. 
 
First we'll test the `rental_units` method to ensure that it can query results properly. 
 
```ruby 
describe ".rental_units" do 
  it "queries rental units" do 
    rental_unit = create(:rental_unit) 
    expect(rui.rental_units).to include(rental_unit) 
  end 
 
  it "sorts by sort param" do 
    rental_units = (1..5).to_a.map { create(:rental_unit, rooms: Random.rand(1..10)) } 
    expect(rui.rental_units.map(&:rooms)).to eq(rental_units.map(&:rooms).sort.reverse) 
  end 
 
  it "paginates results" do 
    (described_class::PER_PAGE + 1).times { create(:rental_unit) } 
    expect(rui.rental_units.size).to eq(described_class::PER_PAGE) 
  end 
end 
``` 
 
Next we can move into testing the links. For this I could probably verify that each of the links was constructed correctly, but for now I'll just make sure that it has the correct keys. I actually have other tests that further test the JSON responses from this controller that look at the actual urls. 
 
```ruby 
describe ".links" do 
  it "builds link hash" do 
    expect(rui.links.keys).to eq([:self, :first, :prev, :next, :last]) 
  end 
end 
``` 
 
Last we'll test the private method `current_page` because it is used frequently when building the links. Some people like to test their private methods while others don't. I generally don't unless I'm using TDD to help me write the method in the first place, or if I want some extra assurances that the code works as expected. Many prefer to test a class purely through its public interface. 
 
```ruby 
describe ".current_page" do 
  context "present" do 
    let(:page) { {number: "2"} } 
    it "finds current page as integer" do 
      expect(rui.send(:current_page)).to eq(2) 
    end 
  end 
 
  context "missing" do 
    let(:page) { {} } 
    it "sets default page to 1" do 
      expect(rui.send(:current_page)).to eq(1) 
    end 
  end 
end 
``` 
 
## Concluding thoughts 
 
Don't be limited to sticking with `ActiveRecord::Base` models in your Rails app. It's easy to forget that you are in fact just writing Ruby code so you are free to use classes however it might help you write a better application. By extracting some functionality out of the controller and into its own class, we accomplished both a cleaner controller, but also better code because it allowed us to more easily test the functionality of building the `index` action's response.
