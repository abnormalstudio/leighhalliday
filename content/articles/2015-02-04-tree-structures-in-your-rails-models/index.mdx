## What are tree structures used for?

Tree structures are needed any time you want to insert a hierarchy into your data. It's when you want to store relationships between data of the same type, vertically. Think of categories, org charts, and family trees; all have a tree structure to them. Some examples of this are.

Categories:

- Electronics
  - Cameras
    - Bodies
    - Lenses

Or when working with organizational structures:

- Product Team
  - IT Department
    - Team A
    - Team B
- Finance Department
  - Auditing

## 3 Types of Trees

In a great article written about [storing tree structures in the database](http://railsware.com/blog/2013/07/15/storing-tree-structures-in-the-rdbms/), Alexey outlines 3 common patterns. They are **parent-child**, **materialized path**, and **nested set**.

Each of these patterns have different strengths and weaknesses, especially related to whether your application is read-heavy or write-heavy.

## Parent-child

Pros: Simple, fast writes. Cons: Slow reads.

Parent-child tree structures are the easiest to understand, are very write-efficient, but can be extremely slow for reads, especially if your hierarchy spans more than 2 levels deep. The reason it is slow on reads is that it can't be done in a single query like the other patterns allow. If you're 5 levels deep and you want to get the top-level parent, you will need to perform 4 queries.

For this type of data, I don't use any sort of Gem to help me accomplish this because it is done very easily in plain Rails. Let's look into how we'd implement this for a Category class.

First, we need to add a `parent_id` column to the database. This is used to determine both the parent and the children of a specific category.

```ruby
class AddParentIdToCategories < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :category, :parent_id, :integer
  end
end
```

Next, we'll add a `parent` relation to our model along with a `children` relation. Because we aren't following the normal Rails standards by naming the field like `category_id`, we have to tell it which class the relation refers to. I chose to use parent and children instead of category and categories, because I find it much clearer.

```ruby
class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :parent, class_name: "Category"
  has_many :children, class_name: "Category", foreign_key: "parent_id"
end
```

Now we can access our data like so:

```ruby
category = Category.find 10 # Result: <Category id: 10, name: ....>
category.children.count # Result: 2
# SQL - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "categories" WHERE "categories"."parent_id" = 10
```

If we wanted to add a method to category to get it's parent's name, or to check if it has a parent and/or children, we could do this:

```ruby
def parent_name
  # it may not have a parent
  parent.try(:name)
end

def has_parent?
  parent.present?
end

def has_children?
  children.exists?
end
```

## Materialized Path

Pros: Fast reads. Cons: Slow writes, more complicated.

This is a pattern that you're most likely familiar with, even if you haven't heard of the name before. Think of it like how the Bible is organized: John, Chapter 3, Verse 16. Each record essentially stores the "path" through it's ancestry. So `John, Chapter 3, Verse 16` has all of the information necessary to go straight from the verse to John, the book.

The [ancestry gem uses the materialized path pattern](https://github.com/stefankroes/ancestry) to handle relationship data in your model. Inserts are fairly complicated, so thankfully the gem handles the complexity for us.

## Nested Set

Pros: Fast reads. Cons: Slow writes, more complicated.

Nested sets are possibly the most complicated to explain, and have very complicated logic when modifying the hierarchy, but provide very fast read-access to the data. The way it works is by adding `left` and `right` bounds to your data. [Awesome nested set is a great Gem implementing the nested set pattern.](https://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set).

Here's an example of Colombia with a couple of its provinces and cities:

- `1` Colombia `10`, **L1**
  - `2` Antioquia `7`, **L2**
    - `3` Medellín `4`, **L3**
    - `5` Rio Negro `6`, **L3**
  - `8` Chocó `9`, **L2**

Colombia has 4 children. 2 of them (Antioquia and Chocó) are direct descendants (1 level below), and the other 2 are second level descendants (Medellín and Rio Negro), children of children.

If you wanted to find direct descendants of Colombia, you could do so with a query like so:

```sql
SELECT * FROM locations WHERE left > 1 AND right < 10 AND level = 2;
```

Or if you wanted to find out how many cities are in Antioquia, you could do so with the following query:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM locations WHERE left > 2 AND right < 7 AND level = 3;
```

## Summary

In summary, if you are working with simple data, not nested too deeply and which isn't too read-heavy, I recommend using the basic parent-child pattern. If your data is multiple levels deep and is read-heavy, I recommend using either the materialized path or the nested set patterns.
