I'm excited to announce that I'll be running a 2 day (weekend) workshop on React! It's called __React Fundamentals & Beyond__ because we'll be starting with the basics, but then learning some cool things like: 
 
- ES6/ES7 
- JSX 
- AJAX with Axios 
- Styled Components 
- React Router 
- MobX (state management) 
- React Motion 
- Real time with Firebase 
- Jest, Enzyme, Sinon (testing) 
- Netlify (deployment) 
 
If you're in or near Toronto, please check it out! March 17th and 18th. It will run out of [RED Academy Toronto](https://redacademy.com/).
