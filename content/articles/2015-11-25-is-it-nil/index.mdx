What is actually happening under the covers in Ruby when you ask if a variable is nil? It turns out that it's way simpler than you may think, and it all comes down to object oriented programming and inheritance.

You've probably heard it said that everything in Ruby is an object... this includes the objects that you make but also the built in objects such as `Fixnum`, `Float`, `Time`, `String`, etc. All objects in Ruby, whether they come with the language or whether it is one that you create, extend from a special built in class called `Object`. This class brings with it a set of functionality, one of those methods being the `nil?` method.

```ruby
Object.methods.grep(/nil/)
#=> [:nil?]
```

So let's go take a look to see what this `nil?` method actually does. To do that we're going to look at the [Ruby source code](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/object.c) which is written in C.

```c
static VALUE
rb_false(VALUE obj)
{
    return Qfalse;
}

rb_define_method(rb_mKernel, "nil?", rb_false, 0);
```

What this code is saying is basically that when you call the method `nil?`, what you are basically doing is calling a method that is an alias of the value `false`... it simply returns the value `false` no matter what.

```ruby
5.nil?
#=> false
false.nil?
#=> false
"nil".nil?
#=> false
```

So what _is_ `nil` then? The only thing that is `nil` is `nil` itself. When you use the `nil` keyword in Ruby, what you're actually getting is the singleton instance of the `NilClass` class.

```ruby
nil.class
#=> NilClass
nil.class.ancestors
#=> [NilClass, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
```

`NilClass` is a child of `Object` which happens to override its parent's version of the `nil?` method to have it return `true`. We can see this by looking again at Ruby's source code:

```c
static VALUE
rb_true(VALUE obj)
{
    return Qtrue;
}

rb_define_method(rb_cNilClass, "nil?", rb_true, 0);
```

If we were to define our own version of `Object` and `NilClass`, the `nil?` methods would simply look like this:

```ruby
class Object
  def nil?
    false
  end
end

class NilClass < Object
  def nil?
    true
  end
end

1.nil? #=> false
nil.nil? #=> true
```

## Concluding thoughts

There is only one thing that is `nil`, which happens to be `nil` itself.
