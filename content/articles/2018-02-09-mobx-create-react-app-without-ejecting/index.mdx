You do not have to eject from create-react-app to get support for decorators and other babel plugins. MobX works fantastic with decorators and I've always been ejecting to get that working... but there is no longer a need to do that!

In this video we'll take a look at how we can get MobX working with decorators without having to eject from create-react-app. We'll be using a package called [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) to accomplish this.

## Packages Used

Here is a list of the packages we used in this demo:

- react-app-rewired
- react-app-rewire-mobx
- babel-plugin-styled-components

## Files Changed

In `config-overrides.js`:

```js
const { injectBabelPlugin } = require("react-app-rewired");
const rewireMobX = require("react-app-rewire-mobx");

module.exports = function override(config, env) {
  config = injectBabelPlugin("babel-plugin-styled-components", config);
  config = rewireMobX(config, env);

  return config;
};
```

In `package.json` modify the scripts to be:

```js
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-app-rewired start",
  "build": "react-app-rewired build",
  "test": "react-app-rewired test --env=jsdom",
  "eject": "react-app-rewired eject"
}
```
