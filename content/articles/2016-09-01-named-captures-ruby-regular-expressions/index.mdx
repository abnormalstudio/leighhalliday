In Ruby we can use the `match` method which belongs to the `String` class to both check a string for a regular expression match but also to extract data using captures.

Captures allow you to extract part of the string... to isolate it. You do this by including `()` parentheses, with whatever that is inside the parentheses being captured.

## Normal Captures

We can see an example below of a normal capture which doesn't assign a name or key to the value being extracted.

```ruby
BALANCE_REGEX = %r{\A\$(\d{1,}\.\d{2})\Z}
value = "$123.55"
if matches = value.match(BALANCE_REGEX)
  matches[1]
else
  '0.00'
end
```

This is fine, but it isn't as clear as it could be. What are we extracting? Is it index 0, 1, or something else? Here is where _named captures_ arrive on the scene.

## Named Captures

What if we could assign a name/key to the value being captured/extracted from our string? Well in Ruby it is easy. Inside of our parentheses we can begin with this: `?<balance>`. It will store whatever is captured by the key between the `<>`.

```ruby
BALANCE_REGEX = %r{\A\$(?<balance>\d{1,}\.\d{2})\Z}
value = "$123.55"
if matches = value.match(BALANCE_REGEX)
  matches[:balance]
else
  '0.00'
end
```

If we take a look at the `matches` variable we'll see that it doesn't just put our capture into `#<MatchData "$123.55" balance:"123.55">`.

We can then easily access it by its key `matches[:balance]`. Much better!
