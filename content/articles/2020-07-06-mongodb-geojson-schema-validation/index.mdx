If you want to save the location of someone, something, or somewhere, you'll need to store its coordinates. In this article we'll be looking at a `Point`, a singular location with latitude and longitude. We'll see how [GeoJSON points](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/geojson/) should be stored in MongoDB to allow for [geospatial queries](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query-geospatial/) efficiently, using [geospatial indexes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/geospatial-queries/#geospatial-indexes). And maybe more importantly, how can you use [schema validation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/) to ensure that the data entering your collection document's is valid?

Did you know there is a data structure specification for encoding data structures named [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/)? It allows you to define different types of geographic data such as a `Point`, `LineString`, `Polygon`, MultiPoint, `MultiLineString`, and `MultiPolygon`.

## A Geographic Document in MongoDB

Storing a Point in a MongoDB Document requires the field to have a name. In our case it is called `location`, which is itself a document with two other fields:

- `type`: One of the GeoJSON geographic types... in our case, a `Point`.
- `coordinates`: An array of two decimal numbers. The first is the `longitude` and the second is the `latitude`.

```json
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "5f0237bdcb57b0146028b79d"
  },
  "location": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-79.3832, 43.6]
  }
  // other fields
}
```

## Querying Nearby Points

By applying a `$near` filter on the `location` field, we can find all points within 100km (100000 meters) of `[-79.3832, 43.6532]`.

```js
{
  location: {
    $near: {
      $maxDistance: 100000,
      $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [-79.3832, 43.6532] },
    },
  },
};
```

## Making Geospatial Queries Efficient

Geospatial queries become efficient by applying [geospatial indexes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/geospatial-queries/#geospatial-indexes) to the fields containing geo data. The type of index that should be used in this case is a `2dsphere`, applied to the `location` field. Voila!

## Validating Points using MongoDB Schema Validation

To ensure that only valid points are entered into our database, we can add [schema validation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/) to this collection of locations which will require that the appropriate fields are always there, with the correct formats.

This schema validation requires that the `location` field exists, that it is an object with a `type` field with an enum value of `Point`, and a `coordinates` field of two numbers, the longitude between -180 and 180, and the latitude between -90 and 90. Thankfully json-schema has array [Tuple validation](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/array.html#id6) which allows us to specify different validations for different positions of elements in the array, which is important in our case where it must be `[longitude, latitude]`.

```js
{
  $jsonSchema: {
    bsonType: 'object',
    required: [
      'location'
    ],
    properties: {
      location: {
        bsonType: 'object',
        required: [
          'type',
          'coordinates'
        ],
        properties: {
          type: {
            bsonType: 'string',
            'enum': [
              'Point'
            ]
          },
          coordinates: {
            bsonType: [
              'array'
            ],
            minItems: 2,
            maxItems: 2,
            items: [
              {
                bsonType: 'double',
                minimum: -180,
                maximum: 180
              },
              {
                bsonType: 'double',
                minimum: -90,
                maximum: 90
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
