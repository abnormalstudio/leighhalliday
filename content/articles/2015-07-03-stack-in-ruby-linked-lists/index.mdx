## What is a Stack?

<img src={StackImage} alt="computer science stack" />

A [Stack](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)>) is an abstract data type in programming which has a variety of uses. The basic premise of a Stack is that you can add a new value to the end (pushing), and you can remove the last value off of the end. This is referred to as LIFO - Last In First Out.

Our Stack will have 3 external methods: `push` (aliased as `<<`), `pop` and `is_empty?`.

### An overview of our classes

Here is a quick high level overview of how the code will be structured.

```ruby
module LinkedList
  class Node
    # Linked List implementation
  end

  class Stack
    # Stack methods reside here
  end
end
```

## What is a Linked List?

<img src={LinkedListImage} alt="linked list" />

To build a Stack we need another data type to help us out. For this we can use an Array or a [Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), which we'll be using in this article. A Linked List is a simple object (we'll call it a Node) which has its own value or data, plus a pointer to the next Node in the list. The last Node in the list points to `nil`.

```ruby
class Node
  attr_accessor :value, :next_node

  def initialize(value, next_node)
    @value = value
    @next_node = next_node
  end
end
```

## Initializing the Stack

There isn't much to do to initialize things. Basically what we need to do is set a @first variable equal to nil.

```ruby
def initialize
  @first = nil
end
```

## Pushing a new value to the Stack

To push a value to the Stack we'll want to create a new Node which has a next Node equal to the current first Node. Then we'll set the first Node equal to the new one we just created. Because Ruby is evaluated from right to left, we can do it in a single line of code.

```ruby
def push(value)
  @first = Node.new(value, @first)
end
```

## Popping a value off the Stack

To pop a value off of the Stack we first want to check if we are already dealing with an empty Stack. If so we'll raise an exception.

Next we'll grab the value of the first Node, make the first Node equal to the next Node of the current first Node, and finally we'll return the value.

```ruby
def pop
  raise "Stack is empty" if is_empty?
  value = @first.value
  @first = @first.next_node
  value
end
```

## Is the Stack empty?

This is the easiest question to ask. All we have to do is check whether the first Node is equal to nil. If so, the Stack is empty.

```ruby
def is_empty?
  @first.nil?
end
```

## Final Version

Here is the final version of our Linked List Stack.

```ruby
module LinkedList
  class Node
    attr_accessor :value, :next_node

    def initialize(value, next_node)
      @value = value
      @next_node = next_node
    end
  end

  class Stack
    def initialize
      @first = nil
    end

    def push(value)
      @first = Node.new(value, @first)
    end
    alias_method :"<<", :push

    def pop
      raise "Stack is empty" if is_empty?
      value = @first.value
      @first = @first.next_node
      value
    end

    def is_empty?
      @first.nil?
    end
  end
end
```

Here is how to use our Stack:

```ruby
stack = LinkedList::Stack.new

stack << "The"
stack << "Quick"
stack << "Brown"
stack << "Fox"

begin
  puts stack.pop
  puts stack.pop
  puts stack.pop
  puts stack.pop
  puts stack.pop
rescue RuntimeError => e
  puts "Error - #{e.message}"
end
```

And here is the output it produces:

```ruby
# Fox
# Brown
# Quick
# The
# Error - Stack is empty
```
