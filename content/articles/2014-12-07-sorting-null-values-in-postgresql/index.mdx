### The Problem

Say you have a table of people and you want to sort them alphabetically by their nickname in descending order (Z - A). That works great as long as everyone has a nickname, but what happens when one doesn't?

```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, nickname
FROM people
ORDER BY nickname DESC;
```

What you'll get is a result with people with null nicknames at the top, when really you want them to show up at the bottom.

```
 Steve     | Roberts  |
 Steve     | Halliday |
 Bob       | Clemens  | Sneakers
 Patty     | Roberts  | Sneakers
 George    | Clemens  | Smelly
 Bob       | Clemens  | Smelly
```

### The Solution

Normally when you choose a column to order by, you do something like `ORDER BY nickname DESC`. Formatted like: `ORDER BY sort_expression1 [ASC | DESC]`. In Postgres there is an extra modifier you can put after the ASC or DESC which tells the database how to handle null values.

For example, if you want nulls to show up last, you would write `ORDER BY nickname DESC NULLS LAST`. The options are either FIRST or LAST. This is formatted like: `ORDER BY sort_expression1 [ASC | DESC] [NULLS { FIRST | LAST }]`.

Now, if we take our example from above, it will correctly put the null values last.

```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, nickname
FROM people
ORDER BY nickname DESC NULLS LAST;
```

The results now correctly have the null values at the bottom.

```
 Bob       | Clemens  | Sneakers
 Patty     | Roberts  | Sneakers
 George    | Clemens  | Smelly
 Bob       | Clemens  | Smelly
 Steve     | Roberts  |
 Steve     | Halliday |
```
